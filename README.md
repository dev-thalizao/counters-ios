# Counters, the app who store your counters ðŸ¤–

The architecture was built using the concepts of Clean Architecture and the SOLID principles. The modularization was composed by:
- [CounterCore](./CounterCore/Sources/CounterCore): Domain layer composed by counter model and all use cases.
- [CounterAPI](./CounterCore/Sources/CounterAPI): Data layer composed by remote implementation of domain use cases. 
- [CounterStore](./CounterCore/Sources/CounterCore): Data layer composed by local implementation of domain use cases.
- [CounterPresentation](./CounterCore/Sources/CounterPresentation): Presentation layer composed by the presenters and view models.
- [CounterUI](./CounterCore/Sources/CounterUI): UIKit interfaces that interact with presentation layer.
- [CounterTests](./CounterCore/Sources/CounterTests): Add extra behaviours specific for unit tests.
- [CounterApp](./Counter/Counter): The main module, that create features and inject the dependencies, control the navigation flow, add new behaviours trough decorators and adapters.
